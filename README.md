This is a blog intended to describe progress for several projects:

o Map Seeking Circuits for recognizing objects in images that use a new chaotic convergence mechanism being developed by Bruno Olshausen at UC Berkeley

o A kite simulator (software and hardware) with lines and a harness hook intended to produce reactions and forces similar to those of a real kitesurfing kites

o Efficient embeddings (lower dimensional metric spaces) of foods, recipes and meals, with the goal of clustering them and finding similarities and replacements, with applications in meal recommendation apps

I am using Jupyter notebooks. This blog is more about commenting code that works that about illustrating ideas using code for now, as I have a lot of code that needs explanations. When I am done presenting this backlog, I'll switch to a more exploratory mode, proposing hypotheses and trying to corroborate them with code at the same time.
