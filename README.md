This is a blog intended to describe progress for several projects:
o Map Seeking Circuits for recognizing objects in images that use a new chaotic convergence mechanism being developed by Bruno Olshausen at UC Berkeley
o A kite simulator (software and hardware) with lines and a harness hook intended to produce reactions and forces similar to those of a real kitesurfing kites
o Efficient embeddings (lower dimensional metric spaces) of foods, recipes and meals, with the goal of clustering them and finding similarities and replacements, with applications in meal recommendation apps
